# Lilith-Run2database
Lilith is a python tool for constraining new physics from Higgs signal strengh measurements at the LHC. The code is available at http://lpsc.in2p3.fr/projects-th/lilith/. The official Lilith release contains an XML database with the experimental results from Run 1 plus some early Run 2 results. 

In this repository we are developing an update of the database with all relevant Run 2 results with 36/fb and beyond.
