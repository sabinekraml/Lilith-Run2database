 Conclusion:
 - Corr. -0.27 is for Cross section, corr. fitted from 2D \mu is arround -0.24 to -0.23. 
 - Case 6 is better than 7.
 - Case 8 is better than 9, but worse than 5, 6, 7.
 - Case 5 is the best. However, the correlation -0.27 is suspicious here!
 - (Should exclude) Case 4 is interesting (as it also yields good result). However, the philosophy of using both Poisson and VGaussian here is bad.
