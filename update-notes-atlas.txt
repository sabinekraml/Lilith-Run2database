*) H -> gamma gamma: HIGG-2016-21   

https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2016-21/    (36 fb-1)

2d likelihood contours in ggH and VBF production: Fig 15
1d intervals for ggH, VBH, VH and ttH production: Fig 12
(1d profile likelihoods in Figs 23a-d)

ATLAS-CONF-2018-028 (80 fb-1) has only cross sections, not the signal strengths



*) H -> ZZ* -> 4l    

https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2016-22/   (36 fb-1)

1d profile likelihood: Fig 6b   (need Run2 efficiencies for different production modes!)
2d likelihood contours in ggH vs VBF production: given as sigma \times Br in Fig 8a; needs to be normalized to SM to convert to signal strength (see Table 1)

The 1d profile likelihoods for ggF and VBF production are given as additional figures 7a and 7b; at a first stage I'd just use these

Plots are on HEPDATA --> https://inspirehep.net/record/1641268/data


https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/CONFNOTES/ATLAS-CONF-2018-018/   (80 fb-1)

1d profile likelihood: Fig 12b   (need Run2 efficiencies for different production modes!)
2d likelihood contours in ggH vs VBF production: given as sigma \times Br in Fig , needs to be normalized to SM to convert to signal strength (tabulated in Table 9?). 



*) H -> WW* -> 2l2nu

https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2016-07/   (36 fb-1)

Fig. 9 gives 2d likelihood contours for sigma \times BR; pure signal strengths not given 
rescale by SM prediction



*) H -> tau tau 

https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/CONFNOTES/ATLAS-CONF-2018-021/   (36 fb-1)

Fig. 9 gives 2d likelihood contours for sigma \times BR; pure signal strengths not given 
rescale by SM prediction


*) H -> bb

- VH, H->bb: https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2016-29/  (36 fb-1)
1sigma intervals for WH and ZH production in Fig 5.
Fig 11 has combination with Run 1 data; can be implemented in database but should not be used together with Run1 results to avoid double conting.

- VBF H -> bb : https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2016-30/     (36 fb-1)
1sigma interval in Fig 6a.

- Update for 80 fb-1:  https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2018-04/
1sigma intervals for WH and ZH production with H -> bb in Fig 3.
1sigma intervals for VH production with different decay modes in Fig 8.

Auxiliary figure 6 actually has the 2d likelihood contours for the Higgs boson signal strengths in the WH, H->bb versus ZH, H->bb plane !


*) ttH 


https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2018-13/   (80 fb-1)
1sigma intervals for H->bb and H->gamma gamma in Fig 5


ttH, H->bb  (36 fb-1): https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2017-03/ 
1sigma interval in Fig 11
