****  H -> gamma gamma: HIGG-2016-21   ****

https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2016-21/    (36 fb-1)

2d likelihood contours in ggH and VBF production: Fig 15
1d intervals for ggH, VBH, VH and ttH production: Fig 12
(1d profile likelihoods in Figs 23a-d)

Validation: 
  - compare -2LogL in 1d from 1d intervals Fig 12 to profile likelihoods from Figs 23
  - 68% and 95% CL contours in mu_ggF vs mu_VBF, corresponding to Fig 15 (but for signal strength instead of sigma*BR)
  - 68% and 95% CL contours in kappa_F vs kappa_V, corresponding to Fig 18b, using a) 1D intervals or profile likelihoods, b) 1D intervals with correlation according to Fig 40b, c) 2D data from Fig 15

  perhaps also
  - 68% and 95% CL contours in kappa_gluon vs kappa_gamma, corresponding to Fig 18a; a)-c) as above


ATLAS-CONF-2018-028 (80 fb-1) has only cross sections, not the signal strengths



****  H -> ZZ* -> 4l  ****  

https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2016-22/   (36 fb-1)

1d profile likelihood: Fig 6b   (need Run2 efficiencies for different production modes!) 
--> used auxiliary Figs 7a (ggF) and 7b (VBF) which show -2LogL vs mu for stage-0 production bins

2d likelihood contours in ggH vs VBF production: given as sigma \times Br in Fig 8a; normalized to SM to convert to signal strength (see Table 1)

Plots are on HEPDATA --> https://inspirehep.net/record/1641268/data

Validation: 
  - 68% and 95% CL contours in mu_ggF vs mu_VBF, corresponding to Fig 8a (but for signal strength instead of sigma*BR)
  - 68% and 95% CL contours in kappa_F vs kappa_V, corresponding to Fig 8b, using a) 1D intervals, b) 1D LogL data and c) 2D data



https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/CONFNOTES/ATLAS-CONF-2018-018/   (80 fb-1)

1d profile likelihood: Fig 12b   (need Run2 efficiencies for different production modes!)
2d likelihood contours in ggH vs VBF production: given as sigma \times Br in Fig 14a, needs to be normalized to SM to convert to signal strength (Table 1). 

no real means of validation ...



*) H -> WW* -> 2l2nu

https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2016-07/   (36 fb-1)

Fig. 9 gives 2d likelihood contours for sigma \times BR; pure signal strengths not given 
rescale by SM prediction



*) H -> tau tau 

https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/CONFNOTES/ATLAS-CONF-2018-021/   (36 fb-1)

Fig. 9 gives 2d likelihood contours for sigma \times BR; pure signal strengths not given 
rescale by SM prediction


*) H -> bb

- VH, H->bb: https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2016-29/  (36 fb-1)
1sigma intervals for WH and ZH production in Fig 5.
Fig 11 has combination with Run 1 data; can be implemented in database but should not be used together with Run1 results to avoid double conting.

- VBF H -> bb : https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2016-30/     (36 fb-1)
1sigma interval in Fig 6a.

- Update for 80 fb-1:  https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2018-04/
1sigma intervals for WH and ZH production with H -> bb in Fig 3.
1sigma intervals for VH production with different decay modes in Fig 8.

Auxiliary figure 6 actually has the 2d likelihood contours for the Higgs boson signal strengths in the WH, H->bb versus ZH, H->bb plane !


*) ttH 


https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2018-13/   (80 fb-1)
1sigma intervals for H->bb and H->gamma gamma in Fig 5


ttH, H->bb  (36 fb-1): https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2017-03/ 
1sigma interval in Fig 11
