** Dec 27, 2018: copied from 21.12 of Loc, then made the following changes: 
Changed dir names to be consistent with the default convention of Lilith: 
+ removed empty spaces in file/folder names: e.g. Run 2 > Run2
+ removed  CMS/Run2/Combined 7, 8, 13 TeV/ , because the files here 
are identical to the files in CMS/Run2/
+ put 77fb/ 36fb/ 80fb/ in Run2, Run1+2 

Following bugs/typos are corrected in comparison to Updated 21.12/new data 21.12/
