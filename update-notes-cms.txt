*) H -> gamma gamma: 

- http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/HIG-16-040/index.html  (36 fb-1)
Fig 17 has 1d signal strenghts
Fig 19 the 2d plot
Validation: reproduce Fig 20b



*) H -> ZZ* -> 4l    

- http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/preliminary-results/HIG-18-001/index.html  (41.5 fb-1, 2017)

Fig 8c has 2d signal strengh in VBF,VH vs ggH,ttH plane
Fig 10 has same for 2016 (36 fb-1) and 2017 (41 fb-1) data and their combination (77 fb-1)


- http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/HIG-16-041/index.html  (36 fb-1)
as above but for 36 fb-1 only --> Fig 8b and 8c



*) H -> WW* -> 2l2nu

- http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/HIG-16-042/index.html  (36 fb-1)
1d signal strengths in Fig 9b, numbers printed on the plot



*) H -> tau tau 

- HIG-18-007: http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/HIG-18-007/index.html  (36 fb-1)
Fig 6 has 1d signal strengths for ZH, WH, gg and qqH (=VBF) production modes 

- http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/HIG-16-043/index.html.   (36 fb-1)
this is the observation paper; for signal strengths use the one above



*) H -> bb




*) ttH 

- http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/HIG-17-026/index.html    (36 fb-1)
this is ttH, H->bb. measured value: 0.72 ± 0.24 ± 0.38, Fig 9b

- http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/preliminary-results/HIG-17-003/index.html    (36 fb-1)
this is ttH, H->tau tau. measured value:  0.72+0.62−0.53, but significance is very low, 1.4sigma.  


*) H -> inv


- http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/HIG-17-023/index.html (36 fb-1)
targets the production of a Higgs boson via vector boson fusion. 
Fig 8b gives 1d likelihood function for different production tags; try to reproduce coupling fit in Fig 9a with this
Efficiencies are in Table 6


*) Combinations

- http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/HIG-17-031/index.html (36 fb-1, combined coupling fit)

Fig 6 has 1d signal strengths in the different production/decay modes. Explicit numbers are given in Table 3.
Validation: reproduce coupling fit of Fig 15; H -> inv fit, Fig 12a, perhaps also Fig 12b

Additional Figure 1 gives correlation coefficients obtained from the fit to data for the model with one signal strength parameter for each production and decay mode combination

Loc did extensive validation of 2HDM fits, including also asymmetric Gaussian approx (4 sectors with a skew)
Note: cba_tb_I_h_2d and cba_tb_II_h_2d show no difference in symmetric and asymmetric cases, need to understand why there is no effect
